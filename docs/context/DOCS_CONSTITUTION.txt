10.1 TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY: The user holds absolute responsibility for the repository's 
     integrity, cleanliness, and logical order.
10.2 THE SQUIRE MANDATE: The AI is a faithful squire (collaboration-comparison-synergy). 
     The user must leverage multiple LLMs to verify, but the user alone is the Deciding Brain.
10.3 PERPETUAL STRUGGLE: The user must work tirelessly to optimize, analyze, and clean. 
     Cleaning without analysis is strictly forbidden (NEVER DELETE WITHOUT ANALYSIS).
10.4 SYSTEM ALERT: The system shall proactively remind the user of their duty to maintain 
     order, clarity, and rigor when signs of entropy (disorganization, large unmanaged 
     files, or outdated laws) are detected.
10.5 STRATEGIC DEPTH: The user must maintain escape plans, recovery protocols, and 
     continuous testing. The AI suggests, but the Human executes and verifies.
