# Tone and Language Policy (Canonical)

## Purpose
Define the linguistic and tonal rules of HUMANIA WS.

This policy is not stylistic preference.
It is an operational constraint designed to:
- improve comprehension
- preserve rigor
- maintain long-term fluency in human–AI collaboration

## Core principle
Tone and language are **tools**, not identities.

They are selected based on:
- document type
- cognitive load
- operational risk
- intended lifespan of the document

## Language policy

### Base language
- English is the **primary technical language**.

### Spanish usage
Spanish is explicitly supported and encouraged when it:
- improves conceptual understanding
- conveys human or cognitive nuance
- supports didactic explanation
- avoids loss of meaning through forced translation

Spanish is not secondary.
It is complementary and intentional.

Full duplication of all content is NOT required.
Bilingual content is applied where it adds value.

## Tone policy

HUMANIA WS explicitly uses **multiple registers**.

Uniform tone is considered a design error.

### 1. Technical–rigorous
Used for:
- decisions
- contracts
- canonical rules
- critical procedures

Characteristics:
- precise
- sober
- unambiguous
- no rhetorical devices

### 2. Technical–didactic
Used for:
- README
- usage guides
- explanations of rationale

Characteristics:
- structured
- explanatory
- focused on “why”, not only “what”
- minimal examples allowed

### 3. Professional–close
Used for:
- warnings
- operational notes
- discipline reminders

Characteristics:
- direct
- respectful
- human, but not informal
- mentor tone, not peer banter

### 4. Human–reflective (limited use)
Used for:
- conceptual introductions
- philosophical justification of principles

Characteristics:
- warm
- concise
- restrained
- never sentimental

## Explicit prohibitions

The following are NOT allowed in canonical documents:
- emojis
- sarcasm
- irony
- marketing language
- motivational rhetoric
- excessive colloquialism
- ornamental academicism

## Mixed usage rule

Within a single document:
- normative sections MUST be technical–rigorous
- explanatory sections SHOULD be technical–didactic
- warnings MAY be professional–close

Tone shifts are intentional and functional.

## Binding rule for AI assistance

Any AI assisting HUMANIA WS MUST:
- respect this policy
- adapt tone to document function
- avoid stylistic uniformity
- prioritize clarity and correctness over personality

Violation of this policy is considered a workflow error.
