# HUMANIA WS (Human–IA Work System)

HUMANIA WS is a **documentation-first work system** for operating complex, long-running technical projects with AI assistance.

It focuses on:
- clarity over verbosity
- reproducibility over improvisation
- fluency over endless chat sessions

This repository is the **canonical source of truth** for rules, contracts, and workflows.
Chats are ephemeral; documents are not.

## What this is
- A structured way to work with AI on complex projects
- A set of contracts and decisions to avoid context loss and UI degradation
- A practical alternative to "living inside one endless chat"

## What this is not
- Not a framework
- Not an AI product
- Not a productivity hack

## Core principles
- Docs first, chat second
- Small, verifiable steps
- Explicit decisions over implicit habits
